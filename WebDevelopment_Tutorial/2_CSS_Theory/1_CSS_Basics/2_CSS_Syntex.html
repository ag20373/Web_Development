Q : CSS Syntax
    -> CSS rule Consists of a selector and a declaration block.
    -> h1 {color : blue; font-size:12px;}
    -> Selector Points to the HTML element you wants to style.(h1)
    -> The declaration block contains one or more declaration separated by semicolons.
    -> Each declaration inculdes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
    -> Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
